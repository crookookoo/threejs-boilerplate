# three-boilerplate
A lightweight three.js boilerplate for quick experiments. [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) library and frequently used js components from [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/) are hotlinked via threejs.org, which makes them always up-to-date, but also unavailable when offline. ðŸ™ˆ

Project code in `main.js`, and `helpers.js` contain mostly project-independent initializations and tools.

If you need to host your own files, run server-starter for SimpleHTTPServer. For live-reloading server use `npm install -g live-server` and then just `live-server` in the project directory.
