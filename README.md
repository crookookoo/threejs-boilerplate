# three-boilerplate
A lightweight three.js boilerplate for quick experiments. [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) library and frequently used js components from [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/) are hotlinked via threejs.org, which makes them always up-to-date, but also unavailable when offline. ðŸ™ˆ
